The globe icon is taken from chromium sources from here:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/resources/default_200_percent/common/default_favicon_64.png.

The license of the icon can be found here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/resources/README.txt.
I copy this license file to this directory into ./LICENSE in case urls become broken.
